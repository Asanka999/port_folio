                    Sometimes in life, the most meaningful journeys begin without a plan. That’s exactly how my sports life started - unexpectedly, yet with purpose that unfolded over time. I never thought I’d become an athlete. But deep down, from my earliest days, I always had a burning love for sports. As a child, while most of my friends were watching cartoons or music shows, I was glued to the television, waiting for one thing - sports news. That was all I wanted to see. I didn't care about politics or business; if it wasn’t about sports, I would switch the channel. I was especially crazy about cricket. I watched every match with passion, memorized player names, and celebrated victories as if I were part of the team. Cricket, in those days, was my first love.
</p><br>

<p>But fate had other plans.

It was during Grade 8, at B/Uduhawara Maha Vidyalaya, that I first stepped into the world of kabaddi. Until then, I barely knew anything about the sport. I joined my school’s team out of curiosity, not expecting anything serious. But that one decision changed everything.
</p><br>

<p>From the very first match, I felt something click inside me. The intensity, the strategy, the team coordination - it was thrilling. I wasn’t the strongest or the fastest, but I had heart. I gave my best in every practice and pushed my limits in every game. Slowly but surely, I became an important part of the team.
                
                Between 2014 and 2017, our school kabaddi team did something incredible - we won the Provincial Championship every single year. That wasn’t just luck; it was the result of hard training, early morning drills, and the unbreakable bond between us players. Each tournament made us stronger, more confident, and more united.</p><br>
                <p>But nothing compares to the moment in 2016 - the year we achieved the All Island Kabaddi Championship. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Representing not just our school, but our entire district, we went head-to-head with the best teams in the country. It was tough, every match felt like a final. But we believed in ourselves. And when that final whistle blew, and we stood there as national champions, it felt like a dream come true.
</p><br>

For a boy who once sat in front of a TV watching others play, I had now become part of a proud history. That victory wasn’t just a medal or a trophy - it was proof that hard work, teamwork, and belief can take you anywhere.

But my story doesn’t end there. As my love for kabaddi grew, so did my interest in understanding the science behind sports. I started to enjoy not just playing, but analyzing the games. I wanted to know how athletes train, how strategies are made, and how data can improve performance. That curiosity became a new goal - to study sports analysis.</b><br>
            <p>Today, I am proudly studying at the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, following my dream of becoming a professional in the field of sports science and analysis. Here, I’m learning how to use technology, statistics, and biomechanics to study performance and improve athlete development. Every class, every project brings me closer to understanding how sports truly work beyond what we see on the field.

It brings me great joy to combine my experience as a player with academic knowledge. My dream now is to help other young athletes - especially from rural areas like mine - reach their full potential. I want to build a bridge between raw talent and professional training, using analysis and strategy as tools for success.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Looking back, it’s amazing how far I’ve come - from a young boy watching cricket highlights to a kabaddi champion and now a university student learning the science of sport. My journey was not planned. It started with a small step, a simple decision to join a school team. But that step led me to discover who I really am.

I believe my story shows that passion can turn into purpose, and even the smallest beginning can lead to something big. Whether you're a child watching sports from a village home or a student searching for direction - never ignore what your heart loves. Sometimes, the game you never expected to play becomes the one that defines your life.</p>
