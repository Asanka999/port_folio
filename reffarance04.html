This experience involved close collaboration with athletes, coaches, and fellow university volunteers. On the first day of the program, we conducted a biomechanical analysis session to assess player movement efficiency and minimize injury risks. Additionally, I contributed to organizing and delivering a First Aid and Injury Prevention program, where we educated athletes on emergency response, taping techniques, and basic injury management. These activities required strong communication, teamwork, and the ability to build professional relationships with individuals from diverse backgrounds. This opportunity not only enhanced my technical and organizational skills but also demonstrated my ability to develop and maintain positive working relations in both academic and professional sports environments.üèì",

During this period, I was responsible for planning and conducting physical training sessions, developing sport-specific drills, and guiding students to improve their fitness levels and athletic skills. Additionally, I applied sports science principles to monitor performance, assess physical capabilities, and prevent injuries. I worked closely with school staff and students, maintaining professional communication and demonstrating leadership and initiative in every task. This internship significantly enhanced my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical school environment, manage responsibilities independently, and support young athletes in their physical development.",
